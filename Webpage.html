			Jason Wu's guide to create a website with HTML and CSS
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Introduction:
		</h2>
		<h3>
			The basics of HTML to create a website starts with an <strong> idea </strong>. <br>
			Any topic or interest of yours can be expressed through a website created through Hyper text markup language <br>
			to get started, you must have a program to write the code. <br>
			The following are programs that can be used:<br>
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Notepad </li>
			<li> Notepad++ </li>
			<li> TextWrangler </li>
			<li> Coda </li>
			<li> Subline Text </li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>
			Once you have a program started, you can start writing your code. <br>
			The first line for all websites must be: "< !DOCTYPE html >" <br>
			Code within HTML will have tags which are enclosed by "<" and ">" symbols. <br>
			Second, the next tag will be the head tag.
		</h3>
		<br>
		<h2>
			The Head:
		</h2>
		<h3>
			The head tag will be the first tag you will encounter with a closing tag. <br>
			A closing tag is similar to a regular tag, but with a "/" infornt of the tag inside of the "<>". <br>
			For example: "< head >" would start the head of the website and "< /head >" would end it. <br>
			<br>
		</h3>
			Within the head tags, there are many things that can be put into it. <br>
			<ul>
				<li> "< meta >"  which sets the website's character type.</li>
				<li> "< title >" sets the title of the website, located on the tabs of the browser.</li>
				<li> "< style >" to edit the design or the CSS of the website. </li>
			</ul>
		<h3>
			These tags will affect the overall webpage and not the specific content within the website. <br>
			The text and formatting of the text and images will be all done within the body tag.
		</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>
			The Body:
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Like the head tag, the body tag will be "< body >" and will end in "< /body >".<br>
			Most of the content will be put within the body of the website from text to images. <br>
			The variety and options are limitless!<br>
			The following are only a few of the tags for the body:
		</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>"< p >" for paragraph text.</li>
				<li>"< table >" for a table of organized text.</li>
				<li>"< img >" for embedding images into the site.</li>
				<li>"< h# >" where # consist of (1-5) for heading size for text.</li>
			</ul>
